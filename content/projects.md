  * February 18, 2019: [Jaantuska Todobaadka](http://abdimalik.com/tags/JaantuskaTodobaadka/) Every week, I publish a single chart that explores and sheds light on important and current public interest issues in Somalia. The aim is to infuse a little data to help raise the level of public discourse. 
  
  * January 30, 2019: [Eyes on Airstrikes: The War on Terror in Somalia](https://talo.shinyapps.io/airstrikes/). An interactive map and airstrike data explorer tool &#8211; to help track and document air raids against terror groups in Somalia. Updated every week or the same day ACLED releases new datasets.
