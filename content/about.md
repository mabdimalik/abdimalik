Hi there, 

My name is Mohamed Abdimalik. I'm a freelance data journalist, consultant and trainer in analytics and data visualization. 

I have many years of experience helping numerous media, nonprofit and public sector institutions in Somalia to manage, model and analyze data to make evidence informed decisions. 

Aside from my core work; I also regularly collect, clean, curate and share open datasets on Somalia. 

I currently live in Mogadishu.
