  In June 2015, Somalia relaunched a nationwide unified high school examinations for the first time since the government collapsed in 1991. The exercise, however, attracted a paltry turn out of around 3,500 students out of the estimated 17,500 in Mogadishu alone at the time. The failed start happened after the ministry of education led by Dr. Khadra Bashiir Ali and 12 private education networks controlling more than 500 schools in south and central Somalia, failed to reach a much anticipated agreement to transition the country into unified exams &#8211; leading to a massive boycott called for by the education network leaders.

Private education networks were formed by local business leaders to fill the void left by the government. Over time, the networks created a cartel-like chokehold over the entire education system. They resisted any form of regulatory supervision or reform. Each network operated its own set of scattered, incoherent and low quality curriculums, resulting in the proliferation of substandard examinations and certifications.

**Progress: Centralized Examinations Taking Hold**

Despite the well entrenched vested opposition; gov&#8217;t led exams were since then, not only held successfully each year, each year had also registered a record growth in the number of candidates, schools, districts and regions joining the national examination system. 

For example, the number of candidates sitting for gov&#8217;t led exams in the second year, i.e. 2016 rose by more than 230% while each subsequent year saw enrollment numbers increasing by an average of over 40% compared to the previous year. 

Today, 5 years later, over 31,000 students are taking the gov&#8217;t exams in over 120 exam centers across 10 out 18 regions in the country.<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized">

**Consolidating the Gains and Going Forward**

Somalia&#8217;s political landscape is fraught with peril. Backlash from vested interests with deep tentacles in the gov&#8217;t routinely undermine efforts by new ministers to introduce reforms. Many initiatives falter at the first hurdle. The success of the education ministry in navigating these precarious set ups and how it had managed to usher and consolidate a new era of trusted service delivery must be celebrated and emulated. Repeatable lessons should be extracted and documented as it may help other ongoing nation-building efforts.

Now, 31,000 students sitting for high school exams in a country with more than 14 million people is really a far cry from the required numbers. The gov&#8217;t needs to continue curriculum reform, improving quality of the examination system and reaching out to new schools and state authorities through dialogue & patient consultation. It&#8217;s also important to acknowledge that progress happens in steps and in Somalia case, in zigzags that often seem fruitless. Officials need to keep forging ahead, achieving milestones and inspiring the nation with tangible results.

Finally, students and parents who had put their trust in the government&#8217;s nascent attempt at centralized national exams are true example of early believers. Fast followers constitute a critical constituency that deserves special attention. They must NOT be let down. Their success and the gov&#8217;ts prospect for success, as it aspires to reclaim legitimacy and role in service delivery, are intricately tied together.
