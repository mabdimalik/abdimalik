Since the rebirth of the Somali government in Djibouti in late 2000, Somalia&#8217;s progress in building viable state institutions were in large part obstructed by frequent political infighting resulting in political instabilities and a series of failed governments. During these tumultuous period, five successive Somali governments churned out sixteen prime ministers: 12 voted in by parliament, and 4 appointed to serve in interim capacities. 

In February, 2017, when former prime minister Mohamed Abdullah Mohamed (Farmaajo) &#8211; who has suffered the shortest stint and a bitter ouster &#8211; was elected Somali president, he vowed to end the country&#8217;s destabilizing political culture, ones and for all. Two years on, his chosen prime minister, Mr. Hassan Ali Kheyre continues to stay in office, despite many failed attempts to hold a no-confidence vote against him &#8211; one of which resulted the counter-ouster of Speaker Jawaari.

This week, I ask if Somalia is going to break away from this tumultuous political life and chart a new golden era of stability. Is PM Kheyre going to break a record? What do you think?
